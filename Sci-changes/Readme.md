Sooo after the journal asked me to make some changes I did them. Not every code was changed drastically-only small adjustments compared to the oldies. 
LC can now save variables of Earth's orbit, and when you run the "Analyze_ap.py" it will print you useful orbital paramaters. Now the analyze codes are all about Medians.
And there are new codes that plot the coordinate system.
