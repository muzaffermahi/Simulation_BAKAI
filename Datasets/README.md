So these datasets are from BC. They contain every simulation's ùö´r_D (In the Excel file it can be found under the
"Amount of Deviation in Earth's orbit because of Rogue" column. It also contains the minimum distance between the 
rogue planet and the Earth, which can be useful if you're into that kind of stuff :D Anyways, BC3.1 is recorded
when the magnitude of the Subtraction Vector is between 10^5 and 10^6 km with 5 * 10^4 km intervals, and the BC3
is recorded when the magnitude of the Subtraction Vector is between 10^6 and 10^7 km with 5 * 10^5 km. To be honest
the datasets and other codes look very messy, so if you have any questions you can mail me, since it's impossible to 
understand some stupid things I did. muzaffermahican@gmail.com . Look I'm sorry alright it's complicated :D
