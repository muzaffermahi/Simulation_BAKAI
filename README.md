# What is Simulation_BAKAI
BAKAI (Stands for Initial values-AI in Turkish) is a simulation that gives you the position of a celestial body(Comets,asteroids etc.) in a given time, such as 60 days or 20 years.,
The reason it exists is when a comet is discovered, it is kind of hard to determine it's trajectory with calculating only sun's gravitational force, even though it would make a good estimate, with this code you can calculate as precise as you'd like. It's ground assumption is that in a small time change in acceleration = 0, then it updates the acceleration with the new position. 
This simulation could be modified to be used to solve any kind of gravitational n-body problem.
