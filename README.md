# What is BC and LC
BC varies a Rogue Planets initial variables approximately 2800 times and plots them all out. After BC is ran, you can check out interesting results and plug one into LC to track what will happen for 20 years or more. When given enough time LC can run for hundreds of years.
The reason it exists is when a comet or a Rogue planet is discovered, it is kind of hard to determine it's trajectory with calculating only sun's gravitational force, even though it would make a good estimate, with this code you can calculate as precise as you'd like. It's ground assumption is that in a small time change in acceleration = 0, then it updates the acceleration with the new position. 
This simulation could be modified to be used to solve any kind of gravitational n-body problem.
